# Arcade Game Project

This is a Udacity FrontEnd NanoDegree Project.
The goal of this game is to score as many points as possible. You score points when you are able to reach the river (top) without colliding into the enemies.


## Game Play

>- Use arrow keys to move up, down, left & right.
>- As you move up avoid contact with the enemy bugs
>-  If you get hit by the enemy bugs you get re-positioned back to initial location
>- Make it to the river, earn points and repeat
>- If you get hit twice the game starts all over.
